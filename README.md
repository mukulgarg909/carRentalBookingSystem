# carRentalBookingSystem
This application runs on http://localhost:3000/ (local server) and is build using node.js, express.js and mongodb
and has the following basic system features:

• Add new cars 

• Book a specific car based on its availability.

• Show the available cars that are available to book on a date, time, seating capacity or other filters.

• Update/Delete a Car from the system and ensure that the car should is not already booked.

I made this project as a backend development task given by WhitePanda Private Limited Company, Bengaluru.
https://carrentalbooking.herokuapp.com/ has application error, As of now I am not able to host it properly with heroku.
But I am working on it and I will deploy the application on herko as soon as possible.
